Ephemera

_Random things I found while wandering the Web._

[_Financial Knowledge Levels and Savings Behaviors of Bermudian High School Seniors at CedarBridge Academy_](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/rtd/864/)
  : Danika's 2006 master's thesis in Family and Consumer Sciences
    Education at Iowa State.  I'm waiting for the song-cycle version.

[Danika on the Musician Monster Podcast](https://musicianmonster.com/mmp011-danika-holmes/)
  : A nice interview on how Danika makes it as an independent musician.
    Includes a strange joke about her being a.b.d. and therefore a
    "college dropout".  But most of it is good advice about touring,
    Kickstarter, and such.  I wonder what an updated interview would
    be like?  (StageIt, Patreon, ....)
